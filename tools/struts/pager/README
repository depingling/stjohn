<jsptags.com> Pager Tag Library v1.1

The Pager Tag Library helps generate Google[sm] and AltaVista®
style search result navigators. It will take multiple pages worth of
information, dynamically split it up into page sized pieces and generate
a browsable index. It does this in a flexible way that allows designers
to give the index just about any look desired.

See the file index.html for full details.
