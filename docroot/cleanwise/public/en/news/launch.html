					<p align="center">CLEANWISE UNVEILS SERVICE TO RATIONALIZE THE $20 BILLION JANITORIAL/SANITARY SUPPLY CHAIN<p>
					<p>Top Manufacturers and Distributors Join Cleanwise to Launch the Cleanwise.com Private Marketplace</p>
					<p><b>MARLBOROUGH, Mass., March 14, 2001</b> -- Cleanwise, a company dedicated to consolidating and streamlining the janitorial/sanitary (jan/san) supply chain, today announced the launch of the first comprehensive Internet procurement solution for the $20 billion jan/san industry.  Cleanwise.com completed its beta program and is now available as a cleaning product and information procurement solution for multi-location businesses.  Cleanwise.com is supported by strategic partnerships with some of the industry's leading companies, including Himolene, Johnson Wax Professional, Kimberly Clark, 3M, NSS, and Rubbermaid.
					</p>
					<p>Cleanwise.com enables large, multi-location businesses to purchase cleaning supplies, information, and related services on the Web.  Currently, these organizations spend large portions of their revenue on cleaning products and services, but they struggle to maintain consistent appearances at all facilities, train employees, and meet regulatory compliance.</p>
					<p>"We built cleanwise.com to address the problems that we faced while working in the cleaning industry," said Keith Alsheimer, president of Cleanwise and a 10-year veteran of the jan/san industry.  "At the same time, we knew what was working and we designed cleanwise.com to complement the existing supply chain.  We aren't an exchange, infomediary, or a vendor-neutral site, because that is not what the industry needs.  We are working within the existing system to enhance and complement the supply chain and better serve the needs of multi-location businesses."</p>
					<p>Cleanwise's founders are cleaning industry veterans who have experienced first-hand the problems and inefficiencies of the existing jan/san supply chain.  Consequently, the cleanwise.com site has been structured to benefit end-users, manufacturers, and distributors by automating the existing supply chain, rather than creating an alternative one.</p>
					<p><b>Cleanwise.com Customers</b><br>
					Using cleanwise.com, purchasing and operations personnel at multi-location businesses can operate more efficiently and profitably at all locations.  By establishing account catalogues of specified products, purchasing managers can control costs and gain purchasing visibility across the company.  In addition, Cleanwise provides 24-hour access to all of the critical information that operations personnel need to do their jobs, including:<br>
                     <ul>
					   <li>Training, technical, and troubleshooting information;</li>
					   <li>Material safety data sheets and OSHA regulations;</li>
					   <li>Personal accounts with reporting capabilities.</li>					 
					 </ul></p>
					<p><b>Cleanwise.com Manufacturer Partners</b><br>
					  Cleanwise.com provides its manufacturer partners with enhanced knowledge of their end-users' purchasing habits and a direct channel to more clearly communicate their marketing messages.  These manufacturers are also able to provide access to consistent training materials and product data through cleanwise.com.
					</p>
					<p>"Manufacturers spend a great deal on sales and marketing, but often our messages are not clearly communicated," said Mike Bailey, CFO of SC Johnson Wax Professional.  "Cleanwise.com lets us communicate directly to end-users, while giving them access to our entire product and service offerings at the touch of a button.  At the same time, we also have unprecedented visibility into customer preferences and buying trends."
					</p>
					<p><b>Cleanwise.com Distributor Partners</b><br>
					  Cleanwise is working with select distributors to provide order fulfillment to its customers.  Cleanwise.com provides these distributors with a new highly-profitable sales channel.  Additionally, through its eStores program, Cleanwise offers distributors a simple, low-overhead way to bring their businesses online and reduce their cost of sales.  These distributors also benefit from cleanwise.com's rich service offering, because their customers can gain access to a wide variety of training and troubleshooting information 24 hours a day.
					</p>
					<p><b>About Cleanwise</b><br>

Utilizing the Web, Cleanwise helps all participants in the jan/san industry realize greater efficiency, control, and cost savings.  Through its Cleanwise.com site and eStores, Cleanwise provides the industry's only complete source for the procurement of jan/san products, services, and training.
