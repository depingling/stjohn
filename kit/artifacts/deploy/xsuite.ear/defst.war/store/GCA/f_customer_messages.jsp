<font color="red"><b>Hanover Uniform Reminder!!</b></font> - Per corporate direction, we have changed the corporate colors/logo from Khaki/Tan to navy blue with white logo. The only reason that anyone should vary from this look would be at the request of the customer. The inventory at the Vendor of the old Khaki/Tan is nearly deplete so the new shirts will begin to make their way to folks as they order. Any remaining Khaki/Tan shirts( small only) and cobbler aprons that the vendor still has in stock will have the old logo on them as those where printed when they were made.<br><br>

<font color="red"><b>Safety!!!</B></font> - Per Patrick Swagger - GCA Midwest Regional Risk and Safety Manager...Remember it is critical when a new account comes on board to "always" order and have stripper boots to avoid any needless injuries when stripping floors.<br><br>

<font color="red"><b>*Swine Flu*</b></font>With regards to the Swine Flu issue:  Please refer to your GCA HR / Safety Manager.<br><br>


<b><font color="#FF0000">*JohnsonDiversey Product Issues*</font></b> - Process to elevate a product issue: Contact your JohnsonDiversey rep and your manager so that they can promptly contact regional safety managers.<br><br>

<b>Effective 08/20/2007</b> Per GCA Corporate Finance, it is now the responsibility of each GCA Regional Manager to collect re-sale tax certificates from our customers that we re-sell supplies to. Please keep this certificate on file and provide a copy to the appropriate supplier. Without this, the distributors can charge tax on all purchase orders. Also, once these are on file, the Account/Regional Manager still needs to check off the "Re-sale button in the checkout screen of GCAware purchasing to keep invoicing accurate.<br>

<b>Effective 03/01/2007, The Green Seal program has been added to GCAware! To search for Green products, go into the product catalog and check the "Yes" button next to the "Green Certified" section. You can view all Green products, or Green products by a specific MFR. For help using this new feature, please contact the Help Desk @ 877-422-4570.</b><br>

<b>Johnson Dispensers/RTD Hook Up Kits:</b> Please be advised that JohnsonDiversey dispensers for J-Fill, Solutions Center, Air Care, Hand Care, RTD Hook Up Kits and others, should be ordered direct thru your local Johnson Market Manager. These dispensers are no charge when ordered directly from Johnson. These items will not be available thru GCAware.<br>
<b>Standardized Safety Product List</b> Effective 11/13/06, there is now a standard safety product list in GCAware for all sites. This list was initiated and approved by GCA's Safety & Risk Management team. Please generate a separate PO for all safety items, with the exception of gloves. This standardized safety list will be rolled out by region and updated on this page. If there is a need to add a safety item to GCAware, the Regional Manager must approve and send the item add template to Corporate Purchasing for approval.<br>

<b>Do not put a date in the "Process Order On" field of the checkout screen</b> unless you want to hold the order from going to the distributor until that date.  (Example: Hold PO for next budget period. Place order when you are out on vacation, etc...)<br>
<b>For all sites being serviced by JanPak</b> The cutoff time for orders that require special next day delivery is 3:00PM. This includes orders that require Regional Managers approval. All these orders must be received by JanPak prior to 3:00 PM. In addition, please remember, that certain sites serviced by JanPak have established delivery schedules. Please work with your JanPak representative (see "contact us") to help ensure that your orders are scheduled for delivery on requested dates.<br>

<b>Will Call Freight Option</b>Will Call option is now available in the drop down menu for orders under $500.00<br>
<b>CHANGES TO ORDERS <font color=red><u>Only orders entered through GCAware will be accepted by our distributor. The distributor cannot modify orders.</u></font></b>Please review your order in your shopping cart and <b><u>before</u></b> you submit it. If you make an error, most fixes can be done by the user. For example, if you ordered too few of an item or forgot an item after the order was submitted. Submit another order for the difference and indicate in the comments section "ship with earlier order, confirmation number NNNNNN, sent on (date of order submitted)". If you're picking up an order at the distributor and need another item or additional quantities, create another order at that time using the terminal at the distributor's counter (indicate in the comments section that it will be picked up and current date). If you ordered too much or the wrong item, you, not the distributor, are responsible for contacting the help desk to correct the order. GCA will be invoiced and your business unit charged for items on the purchase order.<br>
<b>REQUESTING NEW ITEMS</b> It's very important that all supplies purchases be ordered and tracked through GCAware (Cleanwise). This gives us needed control over our spending and provides accurate reporting for operations. All items previously ordered by a site should be available through the order guide or SPL (Standard Product List). Items listed in the order guide should always be in stock and available for scheduled delivery (or pickup). Items listed in the catalog are all other items available to purchase by GCA. This includes items stocked by our distributor and also special order items.
<br>
<b>Some sites will need to order items not in the order guide or catalog. The revised process to add new items is intended to balance control and efficiency. <font color=red>The attached form has instructions for the requestor and GCA Regional Manager to request new items.</font> Completed approved requests are usually loaded by "next business day" and in turn, the distributor can process the GCA order for the approved items.<a href="https://portal.gcaservices.com/sites/home/Paper%20Based%20Forms/Purchasing/Site%20New%20Item%20Request.xls">Click here for the template</a>.</b><br>
