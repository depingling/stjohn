<h1>Cleanwise Cryptographic Package</h1>
<p>
The <code>com.cleanwise.Crypto</code> package is a group of classes
which implement the <b>Cleanwise Secure File Xfer Package</b>. Under
this scheme, files which must be secured are encrypted and bundled
into JAR files along with information that a receiver can use to decrypt
and verify the package on receipt. The files are encrypted using some
form of symmetric cryptography using a one-time session key. Asymmetric
cryptography is used to encrypt the session key with the intended
recipient's public key and the resultant encrypted key is signed with
the sender's private key. On receipt, the receiver can use the
sender's public key to verify the source of the message, and can use their
own private key to decrypt the session key and thence decrypt the whole
package.
</p>
<h2>Key Generation</h2>
<p>
The Cleanwise Secure File Xfer Package (CSFXP) utilizes public key 
cryptography. Sender and receiver must generate public/private key
pairs and exchange public keys. Security of the transfer depends
on keeping the private keys protected.
</p>
<p>
The Java SDK bundles tools for key management, the main one of interest
being <code>keytool</code>. Keytool is described in the Sun
documentation: <code>C:\jdk1.2.2\docs\tooldocs\win32\keytool.html</code>
</p>
<p>
To generate public/private key pair using RSA with MD5withRSA for signing
do this:
<H4>Download and install the ABA implementation of the JCE plus a security provider</H4>
<ol>
<li>Download the ABA implementation of the JCE from 
<a href="http://www.openjce.org">http://www.openjce.org</a> and install
in <code>{JREHOME}/lib/ext</code> directory. This is the directory
for extension packages and by placing the jce.zip file here, it will
not need to be added to the class path, the JVM will find it
automatically</li>
<li>You may need to add it to two JRE directories. I have found that
<code>keytool</code> is run out of the jdk installation directory but
regular programs use a different JRE directory. If you run into problems,
e.g. "Algorithm not available", check which directory your keytool program
is located in.</li>
<li>The ABA package adds RSA and Twofish in addition to several other
strong encryption schemes that are not available with the SUN JCE
Provider. Although, the SUN JCE may be sufficient for most uses.</li>
<li>Add this line to <code>{JREHOME}/lib/security/java.security</code>
<pre>
security.provider.2=au.net.aba.crypto.provider.ABAProvider
</pre>
Without this, the JCE will not utilize the ABA JCE Provider. There are
other providers (some free some not free), theoretically any should work.</li>
<LI><I>Alternate</I> Or, use the <CODE>cwSecurityProvider</CODE> class to dynamically
load the ABA provider. The advantage to this is that it avoids having to install anything
into the JRE, all you need is the have the jce.zip file in the class path - and to have
a security policy that allows the package to be loaded dynamically. 
<PRE>
import java.security.*;
import java.util.*;
import com.cleanwise.Crypto.cwSecurityProvider;
import com.cleanwise.Crypto.cwCryptoException;
import org.apache.log4j.Logger;

private static final Logger log = Logger.getLogger(this.class);

cwSecurityProvider manager = new cwSecurityProvider();
Properties providerMap     = new Properties();
providerMap.setProperty("ABA", "au.net.aba.crypto.provider.ABAProvider");
manager.setSecurityClassMap(providerMap);
manager.loadProvider("ABA");
log.info("ABA Provider is loaded");
</PRE>
<I>Do this in the top level class or the main class, the underlying crypto classes should
not know which providers are being used or where they are to get an implementation of
the algorithms they have been told to use.</I>
</LI>
</OL>
<H4>Generating the keys</H4>
<OL>
<li>Generate the public/private key pair for Cleanwise:
<pre>
keytool -genkey -keystore cleanwiseks -keyalg RSA -sigalg MD5withRSA -alias cleanwise
</pre>
This will create the keystore file <code>cleanwiseks</code> if it doesn't
already exist. If you get an error "keypair generator not available" this
indicates that the ABA package is either not installed or it is not
listed in your <code>java.security</code> file.</li>
<li>Normally, you would request a CA to sign your key, but self-signed
certificates should be sufficient for this application since all
members are known to each other.</li>
<li>The Estore vendor, e.g. Kenway does the same operation.
<pre>
keytool -genkey -keystore kenwayks -keyalg RSA -sigalg MD5withRSA -alias kenway
</pre>
<li>Export Cleanwise public key (so it can be imported into your intended
recipient's keystore.
<pre>
keytool -keystore cleanwiseks -export -alias cleanwise -file cleanwisePublicKey.cer
</pre>
</li>
<li>Export the Kenway public key
<pre>
keytool -keystore kenwayks -export -alias kenway -file kenwayPublicKey.cer
</pre>
</li>
<li>Import the Kenway public key as a trusted certificate into the
cleanwise database (and refer to it by the alias "kenway") :
<pre>
keytool -keystore cleanwise -import -alias kenway -file kenwayPublicKey.cer
</pre>
</li>
<li>Import the Cleanwise public key into the Kenway database (and
refer to it by the alias "cleanwise"):
<pre>
keytool -keystore kenway -import -alias cleanwise -file cleanwisePublicKey.cer
</pre>
</li>
</ol>
<H3>Problems.</H3>
<P>
<I>If the security class is not available or in the path, have encountered java Null pointer
exceptions executing cwSigner constructor - a constructor which is apparently empty and
doesn't do anything - but something must be happening because this crash occurred after I
had removed the JCE package from the <CODE>jre/lib/ext</CODE> directory and from java.security.
The code compiled OK because the appropriate zip files where in the compile class path.</I>
