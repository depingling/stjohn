					<p align="center">CLEANWISE FORGES STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIPS WITH TOP JANITORIAL/SANITARY PRODUCT MANUFACTURERS</p>
					<p><b>Cleanwise Partners with Johnson Wax Professional, Kimberly-Clark, 3M, Rubbermaid, NSS and Himolene, To Provide Jan/San Products and Services Online</b></p>
					</p>
					<p><b>MARLBOROUGH, Mass., Oct. 11, 2000</b> -- Cleanwise, a company developing the first comprehensive Internet procurement solution for the janitorial/sanitary (jan/san) industry, today announced that it has established strategic partnerships with some of the industry's leading manufacturers.  Johnson Wax Professional, Kimberly-Clark, 3M, Rubbermaid, NSS and Himolene all have committed to provide products and services to multi-location organizations through Cleanwise's B2B Web marketplace, cleanwise.com.</p>
					<p>Cleanwise.com enables large, multi-location businesses to purchase cleaning supplies and related services on the Web.  Currently these organizations spend large portions of their revenue on cleaning products and services, but they struggle to maintain consistent appearances at all facilities, train employees and meet regulatory compliance guidelines.
					</p>
					<p>These strategic partnerships ensure that multi-location organizations will be able to solve their jan/san problems by using cleanwise.com as their single source for round-the-clock access to top brand-name products, services and information. Cleanwise is currently working with beta customers and will launch the new cleanwise.com Web procurement solution later this fall.
					</p>
					<p>"Working with Cleanwise provides a new opportunity for us to directly reach out to national, multi-location business that use 3M's products as part of their jan/san solution,"  said Greg Brown, 3M's market development manager for hard floor products. "Cleanwise's Internet-based solution helps automate the supply chain. At the same time, it provides another communication resource with our customers via the Web, they have added convenience, freedom of ordering and the ability to learn more about 3M products and services anytime day or night."
					</p>
					<p>Cleanwise is working with Network Services Company, a multi-billion dollar distribution organization, to provide products to its national cleanwise.com customers.  NSC is North America's largest distributor of housekeeping supplies, sanitary maintenance products, foodservice disposables, and printing papers.
					</p>
					<p>Cleanwise's founders are jan/san industry veterans who have experienced first-hand the problems and inefficiencies of the existing jan/san supply chain. Today, this supply chain is highly fragmented. Cleanwise has been structured to benefit end-users, manufacturers and distributors by automating the existing supply chain, rather than creating an alternative one.  Manufacturers find this an efficient way to service national account business over the Internet.
					</p>
					<p>"These manufacturer agreements are key to differentiating cleanwise.com from other online sites," said Keith Alsheimer, president of Cleanwise.  "We have lived and breathed the jan/san industry and knew that the existing supply chain could be improved via the Internet. At the same time, we weren't looking to reinvent the wheel with cleanwise.com. Organizations are familiar with these manufacturers and they want to buy their products ? we are providing a tool to complement and improve the existing supplier relationships."
					</p>
					<p>Cleanwise's manufacturer partners will provide products and services that help business with all of their jan/san needs.  Products include items such as cleaning chemicals, equipment, paper goods, skin care products and sundries.  The manufacturers will also offer detailed product information and important regulatory/safety materials such as material safety data sheets. Cleanwise will enhance the manufacturers offering with on-site training, troubleshooting and customer care information.
					</p>
					<p>About Cleanwise<br>
					Cleanwise consolidates and streamlines the Janitorial/Sanitary (jan/san) supply chain by providing a comprehensive marketplace where end-users can order name-brand products from best-of-breed suppliers; acquire cleaning services; and access important product, training and administrative information. Cleanwise.com is the only Web jan/san procurement site designed specifically to meet the needs of large, multi-location organizations, such as building service contractors, hospitals, retail chains, large corporations, etc.
					</p>
					<p>Based in Marlborough, Mass., Cleanwise was founded by jan/san industry veterans in December 1999 and is backed by $4 million in seed financing led by Insight Capital Partners. The company is currently securing strategic partnerships with jan/san manufacturers, distributors and end-user organizations and will launch cleanwise.com this fall.
