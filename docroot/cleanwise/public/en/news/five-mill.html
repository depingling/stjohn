					<p align="center">CLEANWISE ANNOUNCES $5 MILLION IN ADDITIONAL FUNDING BRINGING TOTAL RAISED TO $15.25 MILLION <p>
                    
					<p><i>New Investor THK Private Equities joins Johnson Wax Professional and 
Insight Capital Partners.
</i></p>
					
					<p><b>MARLBOROUGH, Mass., April. 16, 2001 </b> -- Cleanwise, a company dedicated to consolidating and streamlining the janitorial/sanitary (jan/san) supply chain, today announced that it has secured $5 million in additional funding bringing the total raised to $15.25 million.  The Series C round includes new investor THK Private Equities, as well as previous investor Insight Capital Partners.  
					</p>
					<p>The company's Series A financing, in February 2000, raised $4 million and was led by Insight, with private investors also participating.  Its series B financing raised $6.25 million in October 2000, with Johnson Wax Professional leading and Insight returning.  </p>
					<p>"The support we've received in this tough financing environment is a strong validation of Cleanwise's vision, business model and technology," said Keith Alsheimer, president of Cleanwise. "By automating existing industry relationships, Cleanwise enables companies in the jan/san supply chain to truly optimize their procurement and operations management processes for the first time, without requiring large investments in information technology.  As a result, Cleanwise has proved to be a strong investment opportunity."
</p>
					<p>The company will use the funds to continue to build out its service infrastructure and expand sales and marketing efforts.
</p>
